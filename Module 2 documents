Module 2: Vehicle Performance, Inventory and Tracking 

1. Overview 

This module manages all fleet vehicles while monitoring their performance and operational efficiency. An extension of this module includes a specialized Emergency Vehicle Dashboard, providing real-time insights for critical response units. 

Objectives: 

Maintain up-to-date vehicle inventory. 

Monitor fleet performance metrics. 

Track emergency vehicles in real-time for rapid response. 

Analyze traffic and route data to optimize emergency operations. 

 

2. Core Features 

2.1 Vehicle Inventory Management 

Maintain vehicle records: model, registration, status, assigned driver. 

Track vehicle lifecycle: acquisition â†’ maintenance â†’ retirement. 

2.2 Performance Tracking 

Daily/weekly/monthly usage metrics: fuel efficiency, distance traveled, idle time. 

Identify underperforming vehicles or vehicles in need of maintenance. 

2.3 Maintenance & Fuel Management 

Schedule preventive maintenance. 

Track fuel consumption per vehicle. 

Alerts for anomalies or upcoming service. 

2.4 Driver Assignment & Monitoring 

Manage driver profiles. 

Track driver performance and incidents. 

2.5 Emergency Vehicle Dashboard 

This sub-module provides real-time monitoring and analytics for emergency services: 

Key Components: 

ðŸš‘ Ambulance Route Status 

Track live location of all ambulances. 

Display estimated arrival times to destinations. 

Highlight fastest routes considering real-time traffic data. 

ðŸš’ Fire Truck Route Status 

Monitor active fire trucks. 

Provide optimized routes to emergency locations. 

Visual alerts for roadblocks or delays. 

ðŸš“ Police Vehicle Tracking 

Real-time GPS tracking of police vehicles. 

Assign nearest units to incidents. 

Monitor patrol coverage and response efficiency. 

ðŸ“Š Traffic Control Analytics 

Dashboard visualizations: congestion maps, traffic density heatmaps. 

Integrate with vehicle GPS data to predict travel time. 

Identify alternate routes for emergency vehicles to reduce response time. 

Benefits: 

Faster emergency response through optimized routing. 

Improved coordination between different emergency units. 

Reduced delays caused by traffic congestion. 

Centralized monitoring for fleet managers and emergency dispatchers.
