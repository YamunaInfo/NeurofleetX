Module 3: AI Control & Traffic Analysis
🔹 Overview

This module integrates Artificial Intelligence (AI) into the traffic management system. It not only monitors real-time traffic data but also provides predictive insights and automated control of traffic signals. The goal is to reduce congestion, improve emergency response, and ensure smooth traffic flow.

🔹 Functional Components
1. AI-Based Traffic Signal Control

Dynamic Signal Timing:
The AI model analyzes live data (vehicle count, speed, density) and adjusts signal timing in real time.

Emergency Vehicle Priority:
If an ambulance, fire truck, or police vehicle is detected, the AI automatically gives it a green corridor.

Adaptive Rerouting:
Suggests alternative routes to drivers in case of congestion or accidents.

Incident Detection:
AI flags sudden changes in traffic flow, which may indicate an accident, road closure, or breakdown.

2. Traffic Analysis Dashboard

The dashboard gives traffic authorities data-driven insights. It has four key sections:

a) Hourly Traffic Volume

Displays vehicle flow per hour using a line chart.

Identifies high-density hours (morning/evening rush).

Helps in scheduling traffic police deployment and signal adjustments.

b) Speed vs Volume Analysis

Scatter chart showing average speed vs number of vehicles.

Helps in understanding road efficiency:

Low volume + High speed → Road underutilized.

High volume + Low speed → Congestion detected.

AI can predict at what volume threshold congestion starts.

c) System Health Monitoring

Ensures reliability of the system.

Parameters shown:

Active Signals (working correctly)

Offline Signals (power/network failure)

Number of Active Alerts (accidents, breakdowns, violations)

System Uptime (%) (availability of cloud + IoT devices)

d) Peak Hour Analysis

Uses historical + real-time data to identify peak hours.

Provides AI recommendations such as:

“Increase green light time at Main Street by 15s during 6–8 PM.”

“Deploy additional traffic police at XYZ Junction during 5 PM–7 PM.”

🔹 AI Techniques Used

Machine Learning Models: Predict traffic density based on past + real-time data.

Regression Analysis: Correlates speed and volume to estimate congestion levels.

Clustering (K-Means): Groups traffic patterns into categories (normal, congested, free-flow).

Time-Series Forecasting: Predicts future traffic volume for the next hours/days.

🔹 Expected Benefits

⏱ Reduced Waiting Time – optimized signals save time.

🏥 Faster Emergency Response – automatic green corridors.

💰 Economic Benefits – less fuel wastage in traffic jams.

🌍 Environmental Impact – reduced emissions from idling vehicles.

📊 Data-Driven Decisions – authorities get insights for infrastructure planning.

🔹 Example Use Case

📍 Main Junction, Erode (Tamil Nadu)

AI detects 1500 vehicles/hour at 6–8 PM.

Average speed drops below 20 km/h → congestion.

AI suggests:

Increase green light duration for NH-47 highway lane.

Shorten green light for local roads during peak time.

Notify drivers via app about an alternate bypass road.
